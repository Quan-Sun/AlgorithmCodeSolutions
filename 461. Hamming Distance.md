The `Hamming distance` between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

Given two integers `x` and `y`, calculate the `Hamming distance`.

Example:
```
Input: x = 1, y = 4

Output: 2

Explanation:
1   (0 0 0 1)
4   (0 1 0 0)

The above arrows point to positions where the corresponding bits are different.
```

**NOTE**: 0 ≤ `x, y` < 231.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def hammingDistance(self, x, y):
        """
        :type x: int
        :type y: int

```

**solution 2**
```python
class Solution(object):
    def hammingDistance(self, x, y):
        """
        :type x: int
        :type y: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        count = 0;
        while(x > 0 or  y>0):
            if(x%2 != y%2):
                count = count+1;
            x = x/2;
            y = y/2;
        return count
```
