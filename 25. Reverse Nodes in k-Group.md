Given a linked list, reverse the nodes of a linked list *k* at a time and return its modified list.

*k* is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of *k*then left-out nodes in the end should remain as it is.



**Example:**

Given this linked list: `1->2->3->4->5`

For *k* = 2, you should return: `2->1->4->3->5`

For *k* = 3, you should return: `3->2->1->4->5`

**Note:**

- Only constant extra memory is allowed.
- You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes itself may be changed.

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
class ListNode(object):
    def __init__(self, x):
        self.val = x
        self.next = None
```



**solution 1: pointers**

```python
class Solution(object):
    def reverseKGroup(self, head, k):
        """
        :type head: ListNode
        :type k: int
        :rtype: ListNode
        """
        if not head or not head.next or k <= 1: return head
        dummy = jump = ListNode(0)
        dummy.next = l = r = head
        while True:
            count = 0
            while r and count < k:
                r = r.next
                count += 1
            if count == k:
                pre, cur = r, l
                for _ in range(k):
                    cur.next, pre, cur = pre, cur, cur.next 
                jump.next, jump, l = pre, l, r 
            else:
                return dummy.next
```

The time complexity is $O(n)â€‹$.



**NOTE**: 

1. At the first line `dummy = jump = ListNode(0)`, both dummy and jump point to the same `ListNode(0)` object. `jump.next, jump, l = pre, l, r,` basically assign three variables. First is assigning `jump.next = pre`. This is equivalent to assign `ListNode(0).next` = new head after this first iteration. At this point, dummy still point to `ListNode(0)`. So `dummy.next` points to the new head after this first iteration. As the iterations going on, `jump` is assigned to other nodes in each iteration. So `jump.next` is manipulating other nodes not the `ListNode(0)`. Meanwhile, dummy still point to `ListNode(0)`. So dummy.next always points to the new head after the first iteration. Why do we need this in second line `dummy.next = head`? Just in case the original list has less than k nodes. This will make sure when you `return dummy.next`, you return the head of the original list, instead of returning None. If you break the first line to two lines like this: `dummy = ListNode(0)`, `jump = ListNode(0)`. The logic won't work, because `dummy` and `jump` now point to different ListNode.

2. `cur.next, cur, pre = pre, cur.next, cur` can not be replaced by `cur.next = pre; cur = cur.next; pre = cur`. Because 

   ```python
   a, b = b, a
   # is equal to
   a_tmp = a
   b_tmp = b
   a = b_tmp
   b = a_tmp
   # not 
   a = b
   b = a
   ```

   

**solution 2**

```python
class Solution(object):
    def reverseKGroup(self, head, k):
        """
        :type head: ListNode
        :type k: int
        :rtype: ListNode
        """
        if not head or not head.next or k <= 1: return head
        count, node = 0, head
        while node and count < k:
            node = node.next
            count += 1
        if count < k: return head
        new_head, prev = self.reverse(head, count)
        head.next = self.reverseKGroup(new_head, k)
        return prev
    
    def reverse(self, head, count):
        prev, cur, nxt = None, head, head
        while count > 0:
            nxt = cur.next
            cur.next = prev
            prev = cur
            cur = nxt
            count -= 1
        return (cur, prev)
```

The time complexity is $O(n)$.
