Say you have an array for which the *i*<sup>th</sup> element is the price of a given stock on day *i*.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).

**Note:** You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

Example:

```
Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
```



```
Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are
             engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.
```



```
Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
```

**solution 1**

```python
class Solution(object):
    def maxProfit(self, prices):
        """
        :type prices: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        if len(prices) == 0:
            return 0
        
        profit = 0 
        start = prices[0]
        for p in prices[1:]:
            if p>start:
                profit += p - start
                start = p
            else:
                start = p
        return profit
```

The time complexity is O(n).



**solution 2**

```python
class Solution(object):
    def maxProfit(self, prices):
        """
        :type prices: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        return sum(max(prices[i + 1] - prices[i], 0) for i in range(len(prices) - 1))
```

The time complexity is O(n).



**solution 3**

```python
class Solution(object):
    def maxProfit(self, prices):
        """
        :type prices: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        if len(prices) < 2:
            return 0
        
        buy, sell = -prices[0], 0
        for i in range(len(prices)):
            
            buy = max(buy,  sell - prices[i])
            sell = max(sell, buy + prices[i] )
        
        return sell
```

The time complexity is O(n).
