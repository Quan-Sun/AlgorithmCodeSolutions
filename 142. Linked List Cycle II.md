Given a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return `null`.

To represent a cycle in the given linked list, we use an integer `pos` which represents the position (0-indexed) in the linked list where tail connects to. If `pos` is `-1`, then there is no cycle in the linked list.

**Note:** Do not modify the linked list.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: tail connects to node index 1
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: tail connects to node index 0
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the first node.

**Example 3:**

```
Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: no cycle
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.

**Idea:** 

```
Consider the following linked list, where E is the cylce entry and X, the crossing point of fast and slow.
        H: distance from head to cycle entry E
        D: distance from E to X
        L: cycle length
                          _____
                         /     \
        head_____H______E       \
                        \       /
                         X_____/   
        
    
If fast and slow both start at head, when fast catches slow, slow has traveled H+D and fast 2(H+D). 
Assume fast has traveled n loops in the cycle, we have:
  2H + 2D = H + D + L  -->  H + D = nL  --> H = nL - D
Assume n = 1, so H = L - D, that means the distance from slow pointer to E is equal to from head to E.
```

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
class ListNode(object):
    def __init__(self, x):
        self.val = x
        self.next = None

class Solution(object):
    def detectCycle(self, head):
        """
        :type head: ListNode
        :rtype: ListNode
        """
        if not head: return 
        slow = fast = head
        while fast and fast.next:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next
            if slow == fast:
                break
        else:
            return None
        while head != slow:
            slow = slow.next
            head = head.next
        return head
```

The time complexity is $O(n)$.
