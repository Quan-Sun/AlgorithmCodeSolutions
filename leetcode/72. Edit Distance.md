Given two words *word1* and *word2*, find the minimum number of operations required to convert *word1* to *word2*.

You have the following 3 operations permitted on a word:

1. Insert a character
2. Delete a character
3. Replace a character

**Example 1:**

```
Input: word1 = "horse", word2 = "ros"
Output: 3
Explanation: 
horse -> rorse (replace 'h' with 'r')
rorse -> rose (remove 'r')
rose -> ros (remove 'e')
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: word1 = "intention", word2 = "execution"
Output: 5
Explanation: 
intention -> inention (remove 't')
inention -> enention (replace 'i' with 'e')
enention -> exention (replace 'n' with 'x')
exention -> exection (replace 'n' with 'c')
exection -> execution (insert 'u')
```

        :type word1: str

        :rtype: int

        m, n = len(word1), len(word2)
        # dp[i][j]: minimum # of operations of word1[0:i] -> word2[0:j]
        dp = [[0 for i in range(n+1)] for j in range(m+1)]
        dp[0][0] = 0
        # when word2 is empty, just delete all chars in word1
        for i in range(1, m+1):
            dp[i][0] = i
        # when word1 is empty, just inset all chars in word2
        for j in range(1, n+1):
            dp[0][j] = j
        
        for i in range(1, m+1):
            for j in range(1, n+1):
                if (i,j) in memo: continue
                if word1[i-1] == word2[j-1]:
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]
                else:   
                # insert: dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1] + 1 // word1 = 'abc', word2 = 'cdcd'; dp[3][4] = dp[3][3] + 1
                # delete: dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + 1 // word1 = 'abcd', word2 = 'cdc'; dp[4][3] = dp[3][3] + 1
                # replace: dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1 // word1 = 'abcd', word2 = 'cdcb'; dp[4][4] = dp[3][3] + 1
                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j-1]+1, dp[i-1][j]+1, dp[i-1][j-1]+1)
        return dp[-1][-1]
```

The time complexity is $O(m*n)$.
