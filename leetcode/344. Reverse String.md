Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters `char[]`.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with `O(1)` extra memory.

You may assume all the characters consist of `printable ascii` characters.

Example:
```
Input: ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
```

```
Input: ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
```

**solution 1**
```python
class Solution(object):
    def reverseString(self, s):
        """
        :type s: List[str]
        :rtype: None Do not return anything, modify s in-place instead.
        """
        if not s: return
        return s.reverse()
```
The time complexity is O(n).

**solution 2**
```python
class Solution(object):
    def reverseString(self, s):
        """
        :type s: List[str]
        :rtype: None Do not return anything, modify s in-place instead.
        """
        if not s:
            return
        left, right = 0, len(s) - 1
        while left < right:
            s[left], s[right] = s[right], s[left]
            left += 1
            right -= 1
        return s
```
The time complexity is O(n).
