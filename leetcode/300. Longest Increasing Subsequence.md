Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest increasing subsequence.

**Example:**

```
Input: [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
Output: 4 
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4. 
```

**Note:**

- There may be more than one LIS combination, it is only necessary for you to return the length.
- Your algorithm should run in O(*n2*) complexity.

**Follow up:** Could you improve it to O(*n* log *n*) time complexity?

**solution 1**

```python
# DP: backpropagation
# dp[i]: LIS ends with nums[i]; if j in range(0, i) and  dp[j] is LIS ends with nums[j], dp[i] is based on dp[j], which means that if nums[i] > nums[j], dp[i] = dp[j] + 1 and we need to compare the original dp[i] with the updated one and choose the higher.
class Solution(object):
    def lengthOfLIS(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        if not nums: return 0
        n = len(nums)
        dp = [1] * n
        # dp[i] is length of LIS ends with nums[i]
        for i in range (1, n):
            for j in range(i):
                if nums[i] >nums[j]:
                    dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j]+1)
        return max(dp)
```

The time complexity is $O(n^2)$.

**solution 2**

```python
class Solution(object):
    def lengthOfLIS(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        if not nums: return 0
        tails = [0] * len(nums)
        size = 0
        for num in nums:
            lo, hi = 0, size
            while lo != hi:
                mid = (lo + hi) / 2
                if tails[mid] < num:
                    lo = mid + 1
                else:
                    hi = mid
            tails[lo] = num
            size = max(lo + 1, size)
        return size
```

The time complexity is $O(nlogn)$.

**solution 3**

```python
# Binary Search: forward propagation
# find num consisting LIS, so push num in the list - temp. If num > temp[-1], that means num can be pushed into temp to compose a longer sequence; If num < temp[-1], we can find a position in temp to insert it (the length of temp isn't changed but we update temp to make it longer with high potential, i.e. [1,3,9] has higher potential to be longer than [1,6,9]. Findig the position by binary search.
import bisect
class Solution(object):
    def lengthOfLIS(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        def search(nums, target):
            l, r = 0, len(nums) - 1
            while l <= r:
                mid = (l + r) // 2
                if nums[mid] < target:
                    l = mid + 1
                else:
                    r = mid - 1 
            return l
                    
        
        temp = []
        for num in nums:
            if not temp: 
                temp.append(num)
            elif num > temp[-1]:
                temp.append(num)
            elif num < temp[-1]:
                pos = search(temp, num)
                # pos = bisect.bisect_left(temp, num) # we can use this binary search lib that is more convinent
                temp[pos]=num
        return len(temp)
```

The time complexity is $O(nlogn)$.
