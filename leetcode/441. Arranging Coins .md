You have a total of *n* coins that you want to form in a staircase shape, where every *k*-th row must have exactly *k* coins.

Given *n*, find the total number of **full** staircase rows that can be formed.

*n* is a non-negative integer and fits within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.

**Example 1:**

```
n = 5

The coins can form the following rows:
¤
¤ ¤
¤ ¤

Because the 3rd row is incomplete, we return 2.
```



**Example 2:**

```
n = 8

The coins can form the following rows:
¤
¤ ¤
¤ ¤ ¤
¤ ¤

Because the 4th row is incomplete, we return 3.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def arrangeCoins(self, n):
        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        if not n: return 0
        l, r = 0, n
        while l <= r:
            mid = (l + r) // 2
            if self.helper(mid) == n:
                return mid
            elif self.helper(mid) > n:
                r = mid - 1
            else:
                l = mid + 1
        return r
        
    
    def helper(self, x):
        return (1 + x)*x // 2
```

The time complexity is $O(logn)$.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def arrangeCoins(self, n):
        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        return int((math.sqrt(1+8*n)-1)/2)
```

The time complexity is $O(1)$.
