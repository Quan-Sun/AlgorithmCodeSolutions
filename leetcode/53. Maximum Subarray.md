Given an integer array `nums`, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

**Example:**

```
Input: [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4],
Output: 6
Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.
```

If you have figured out the O(*n*) solution, try coding another solution using the divide and conquer approach, which is more subtle.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def maxSubArray(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        if not nums: return
        n = len(nums)
        if n == 1: return nums[0]
        dp = [0] * n
        dp[0] = nums[0]
        for i in range(1, n):
            dp[i] = max(dp[i-1] + nums[i], nums[i])
        return max(dp)
```

The time complexity is $O(n)$.
