Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e.,  `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might become  `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`).

Find the minimum element.

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [3,4,5,1,2] 
Output: 1
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
Output: 0
```

class Solution(object):
    def findMin(self, nums):

        if not nums: return 
        n = len(nums)
        lo, hi = 0, n-1
        minimum = float('inf')
        while lo <= hi:
            mid = (lo + hi) // 2
            if nums[lo] <= nums[mid]:
                minimum = min(nums[lo], minimum)
                lo = mid + 1
            if nums[mid] <= nums[hi]:
                minimum = min(nums[mid], minimum)
                hi = mid - 1
        return int(minimum)
```

The time complexity is $O(logn)$.
