Given *n* non-negative integers representing the histogram's bar height where the width of each bar is 1, find the area of largest rectangle in the histogram.

Above is a histogram where width of each bar is 1, given height = `[2,1,5,6,2,3]`.

The largest rectangle is shown in the shaded area, which has area = `10` unit.

 

**Example:**

```
Input: [2,1,5,6,2,3]
Output: 10
```

```python
class Solution(object):
    def largestRectangleArea(self, heights):
        """
        :type heights: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        if not heights: 0
        n = len(heights)
        heights += [0]
        # increasing array 
        stack = [-1]
        area = 0
        for i in range(n+1):
            while heights[i] < heights[stack[-1]]:
                height = heights[stack.pop()]
                width = i - 1 - stack[-1]
                area = max(area, height * width)
            stack.append(i)
        return area
```

The time complexity is $O(n)$.

```python
# It is more natural to think about this way. Let left[i] to indicate how many bars to the left (including the bar at index i) are equal or higher than bar[i], right[i] is that to the right of bar[i], so the the square of the max rectangle containing bar[i] is simply height[i] * (left[i] + right[i] - 1)
class Solution:
    # @param height, a list of integer
    # @return an integer
    def largestRectangleArea(self, height):
        n = len(height)

        # left[i], right[i] represent how many bars are >= than the current bar

        left = [1] * n
        right = [1] * n
        max_rect = 0

        # calculate left
        for i in range(0, n):
            j = i - 1
            while j >= 0:
                if height[j] >= height[i]:
                    left[i] += left[j]
                    j -= left[j]
                else: break

        # calculate right
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            j = i + 1
            while j < n:
                if height[j] >= height[i]:
                    right[i] += right[j]
                    j += right[j]
                else: break

        for i in range(0, n):
            max_rect = max(max_rect, height[i] * (left[i] + right[i] - 1))

        return max_rect
```
