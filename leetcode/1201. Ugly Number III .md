Write a program to find the `n`-th ugly number.

Ugly numbers are **positive integers** which are divisible by `a` **or** `b` **or** `c`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 3, a = 2, b = 3, c = 5
Output: 4
Explanation: The ugly numbers are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10... The 3rd is 4.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 4, a = 2, b = 3, c = 4
Output: 6
Explanation: The ugly numbers are 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12... The 4th is 6.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: n = 5, a = 2, b = 11, c = 13
Output: 10
Explanation: The ugly numbers are 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13... The 5th is 10.
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: n = 1000000000, a = 2, b = 217983653, c = 336916467
Output: 1999999984
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n, a, b, c <= 10^9`
- `1 <= a * b * c <= 10^18`
- It's guaranteed that the result will be in range `[1, 2 * 10^9]`

```python
import math
class Solution(object):
    def nthUglyNumber(self, n, a, b, c):
        """
        :type n: int
        :type a: int
        :type b: int
        :type c: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        # least common multiple
        def lcm(x, y):
            return (x * y) // math.gcd(x, y)

        lcm1 = lcm(a, b)
        lcm2 = lcm(b, c)
        lcm3 = lcm(c, a)
        lcm4 = lcm(lcm1, lcm2)

        # count how many ugly numbers exist below x
        def count_below(x):
            return x // a + x // b + x // c + x // lcm4 - (x // lcm1 + x // lcm2 + x // lcm3)

        # binary search
        l = 0
        r = 2 * 10 ** 9
        while l <= r:
            mid = (l + r) >> 1
            if count_below(mid) >= n:
                r = mid - 1
            else:
                l = mid + 1
        return l
```

The time complexity is $O(logn)$.
