Every email consists of a local name and a domain name, separated by the @ sign.

For example, in `alice@leetcode.com`, `alice` is the local name, and `leetcode.com` is the domain name.

Besides lowercase letters, these emails may contain `'.'`s or `'+'`s.

If you add periods (`'.'`) between some characters in the **local name** part of an email address, mail sent there will be forwarded to the same address without dots in the local name.  For example, `"alice.z@leetcode.com"` and `"alicez@leetcode.com"` forward to the same email address.  (Note that this rule does not apply for domain names.)

If you add a plus (`'+'`) in the **local name**, everything after the first plus sign will be **ignored**. This allows certain emails to be filtered, for example `m.y+name@email.com` will be forwarded to `my@email.com`.  (Again, this rule does not apply for domain names.)

It is possible to use both of these rules at the same time.

Given a list of `emails`, we send one email to each address in the list.  How many different addresses actually receive mails? 

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: ["test.email+alex@leetcode.com","test.e.mail+bob.cathy@leetcode.com","testemail+david@lee.tcode.com"]
Output: 2
Explanation: "testemail@leetcode.com" and "testemail@lee.tcode.com" actually receive mails
```

 

**Note:**

- `1 <= emails[i].length <= 100`
- `1 <= emails.length <= 100`
- Each `emails[i]` contains exactly one `'@'` character.
- All local and domain names are non-empty.
- Local names do not start with a `'+'` character.

**solution 1**

```python
class Solution(object):
    def numUniqueEmails(self, emails):
        """
        :type emails: List[str]
        :rtype: int
        """
        unique = []
        for email in emails:
            idx = email.find('@')
            chunk = email[:idx]
            host = email[idx+1:]
            local = ''
            for char in chunk:
                if char != '.' and char != '+':
                    local += char
                if char == '+':
                    break
            femail = local + '@' + host
            unique.append(femail)
        return len(set(unique))
```

The time complexity is $O(kN)$.

**solution 2**

```python
class Solution(object):
    def numUniqueEmails(self, emails):
        """
        :type emails: List[str]
        :rtype: int
        """
        res = []
        for email in emails:
            local, domain = email.split('@')
            local = local.replace('.', '')
            local = local.split('+')[0]
            femail = local + '@' + domain
            if femail not in res:
                res.append(femail)
        return len(res)
```

The time complexity is $O(n)$.
