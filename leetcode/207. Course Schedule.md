There are a total of *n* courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `n-1`.

Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: `[0,1]`

Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite **pairs**, is it possible for you to finish all courses?

**Example 1:**

```python
Input: 2, [[1,0]] 
Output: true
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
             To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
```

**Example 2:**

```python
Input: 2, [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: false
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
             To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you 							 should also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.
```

**Note:**

1. The input prerequisites is a graph represented by **a list of edges**, not adjacency matrices. Read more about [how a graph is represented](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/graph-representation/a/representing-graphs).
2. You may assume that there are no duplicate edges in the input prerequisites.

```python
class Solution:
# @param {integer} numCourses
# @param {integer[][]} prerequisites
# @return {boolean}
    def canFinish(self, numCourses, prerequisites):
        graph = [[] for _ in range(numCourses)]
        visit = [0 for _ in range(numCourses)]
        for x, y in prerequisites:
            graph[x].append(y)
        def dfs(i):
            # if ith node is marked as being visited, then a cycle is found
            if visit[i] == -1:
                return False
            # if it is done visted, then do not visit again
            if visit[i] == 1:
                return True
            # mark as being visited
            visit[i] = -1
            # visit all the neighbours
            for j in graph[i]:
                if not dfs(j):
                    return False
            # after visit all the neighbours, mark it as done visited
            visit[i] = 1
            return True
        for i in range(numCourses):
            if not dfs(i):
                return False
        return True
```

The time complexity is $O(n)$.
