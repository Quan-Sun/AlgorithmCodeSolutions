Given a reference of a node in a **connected** undirected graph, return a [**deep copy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_copying#Deep_copy) (clone) of the graph. Each node in the graph contains a val (`int`) and a list (`List[Node]`) of its neighbors.

 

**Example:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/02/19/113_sample.png)

```python
Input:
{"$id":"1","neighbors":[{"$id":"2","neighbors":[{"$ref":"1"},{"$id":"3","neighbors":[{"$ref":"2"},{"$id":"4","neighbors":[{"$ref":"3"},{"$ref":"1"}],"val":4}],"val":3}],"val":2},{"$ref":"4"}],"val":1}

Explanation:
Node 1's value is 1, and it has two neighbors: Node 2 and 4.
Node 2's value is 2, and it has two neighbors: Node 1 and 3.
Node 3's value is 3, and it has two neighbors: Node 2 and 4.
Node 4's value is 4, and it has two neighbors: Node 1 and 3.
```

 

**Note:**

1. The number of nodes will be between 1 and 100.
2. The undirected graph is a [simple graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)#Simple_graph), which means no repeated edges and no self-loops in the graph.
3. Since the graph is undirected, if node *p* has node *q* as neighbor, then node *q* must have node *p* as neighbor too.
4. You must return the **copy of the given node** as a reference to the cloned graph.

**solution 1: BFS**

```python
class Node(object):
  def __init__(self, x, neighbors):
    self.val = x
    self.neighbors = neighbors

class Solution(object):
  def cloneGraph(self, node):
    	"""
      :type node: Node
      :rtype: Node
      """
      if not node: return
      copyNode = Node(node.val, [])
      visited = {node: copyNode}
      queue = collections.deque([node])
      while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        for neighbor in node.neighbors:
          if neighbor not in visited:
            copyNeighbor = Node(neighbor.val, [])
            visited[neighbor] = copyNeighbor
            visied[node].neighbors.append(copyNeighbor)
            queue.append(neighbor)
          else:
            visted[node].neighbors.append(visited[neighbor])
			return copyNode
```

The time complexity is $O(n)$.

**solution 2: DFS**

```python
class Solution(object):
    def cloneGraph(self, node):
        """
        :type node: Node
        :rtype: Node
        """
        if not node:
            return 
        nodeCopy = Node(node.val, [])
        visited = {node: nodeCopy}
        stack = [node]
        while stack:
            node = stack.pop()
            for neighbor in node.neighbors:
                if neighbor not in visited:
                    neighborCopy = Node(neighbor.val, [])
                    visited[neighbor] = neighborCopy
                    visited[node].neighbors.append(neighborCopy)
                    stack.append(neighbor)
                else:
                    visited[node].neighbors.append(visited[neighbor])
        return nodeCopy
```

The time complexity is $O(n)$.

**solution 3: DFS recursively**

```python
class Solution(object):
    def cloneGraph(self, node):
        """
        :type node: Node
        :rtype: Node
        """
        if not node:
        		return 
        nodeCopy = Node(node.val, [])
        visited = {node: nodeCopy}
        self.dfs(node, visited)
        return nodeCopy
    
    def dfs(self, node, visited):
        for neighbor in node.neighbors:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                neighborCopy = Node(neighbor.val, [])
                visited[neighbor] = neighborCopy
                visited[node].neighbors.append(neighborCopy)
                self.dfs(neighbor, visited)
            else:
                dic[node].neighbors.append(visited[neighbor])        
```

The time complexity is $O(n)$.
