Remember the story of Little Match Girl? By now, you know exactly what matchsticks the little match girl has, please find out a way you can make one square by using up all those matchsticks. You should not break any stick, but you can link them up, and each matchstick must be used **exactly** one time.

Your input will be several matchsticks the girl has, represented with their stick length. Your output will either be true or false, to represent whether you could make one square using all the matchsticks the little match girl has.

**Example 1:**

```python
Input: [1,1,2,2,2]
Output: true

Explanation: You can form a square with length 2, one side of the square came two sticks with length 1.
```



**Example 2:**

```python
Input: [3,3,3,3,4]
Output: false

Explanation: You cannot find a way to form a square with all the matchsticks.
```



**Note:**

1. The length sum of the given matchsticks is in the range of `0` to `10^9`.
2. The length of the given matchstick array will not exceed `15`.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def makesquare(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: bool
        """
        if not nums: return False
        m = len(nums)
        total_len = sum(nums)
        nums.sort(reverse=True)
        if len(nums) < 4: return False
        if total_len % 4: return False
        l_square = total_len/4
        sq = [l_square] * 4
        return self.dfs(nums, 0, sq)
    
    def dfs(self, nums, pos, sq):
        if pos == len(nums):
            return True        
        for i in range(4):
            if sq[i] == 0: continue
            if nums[pos] <= sq[i]:
                sq[i] -= nums[pos]
                if self.dfs(nums, pos+1, sq): return True
                sq[i] += nums[pos]
        return False
```

The time complexity is $O(4^n)$.
