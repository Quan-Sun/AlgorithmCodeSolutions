Given a n-ary tree, find its maximum depth.

The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

For example, given a `3-ary` tree:

We should return its max depth, which is 3.

 

**Note:**

1. The depth of the tree is at most `1000`.
2. The total number of nodes is at most `5000`.

```python
# Definition for a Node.
class Node(object):
    def __init__(self, val, children):
        self.val = val
        self.children = children
```

**solution 1: DFS**

```python
class Solution(object):
    def maxDepth(self, root):
        """
        :type root: Node
        :rtype: int
        """
        if not root: return 0
        if not root.children: return 1
        return max(self.maxDepth(node) for node in root.children) + 1
```

The time complexity is $O(n)$.

**solution 2**

```python
class Solution(object):
    def maxDepth(self, root):
        """
        :type root: Node
        :rtype: int
        """
        if not root: return 0
        depth = 0
        stack = [root]
        while stack:
            next_level = []
            while stack:
                node = stack.pop()
                if node.children:
                    next_level += node.children
            stack = next_level
            depth += 1
        return depth
```

The time complexity is $O(n)$.
