Given an array *nums* containing *n* + 1 integers where each integer is between 1 and *n* (inclusive), prove that at least one duplicate number must exist. Assume that there is only one duplicate number, find the duplicate one.

**Example 1:**

```python
Input: [1,3,4,2,2]
Output: 2
```

**Example 2:**

```python
Input: [3,1,3,4,2]
Output: 3
```

**Note:**

1. You **must not** modify the array (assume the array is read only).
2. You must use only constant, *O*(1) extra space.
3. Your runtime complexity should be less than $O(n^2)$.
4. There is only one duplicate number in the array, but it could be repeated more than once.

**solution 1: pegionhole principle**

```python
class Solution(object):
    def findDuplicate(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        low = 1
        high = len(nums)-1
        
        while low < high:
            mid = (high+low)/2
            count = 0
            for i in nums:
                if i <= mid:
                    count+=1
            if count <= mid:
                low = mid+1
            else:
                high = mid
        return low
```

The time complexity is $O(nlogn)$.

**solution 2: Tortoise & Haire cycle detection**

```python
class Solution(object):
    def findDuplicate(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        if len(nums) > 1:
            slow = nums[0]
            fast = nums[nums[0]]
            while slow != fast:
                slow = nums[slow]
                fast = nums[nums[fast]]
            fast = 0
            while slow != fast:
                slow = nums[slow]
                fast = nums[fast]
            return slow
```

The time complexity is $O(n)$.
