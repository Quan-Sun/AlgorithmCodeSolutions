Given an array `A`, we can perform a *pancake flip*: We choose some positive integer `**k** <= A.length`, then reverse the order of the first **k** elements of `A`.  We want to perform zero or more pancake flips (doing them one after another in succession) to sort the array `A`.

Return the k-values corresponding to a sequence of pancake flips that sort `A`.  Any valid answer that sorts the array within `10 * A.length` flips will be judged as correct.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [3,2,4,1]
Output: [4,2,4,3]
Explanation: 
We perform 4 pancake flips, with k values 4, 2, 4, and 3.
Starting state: A = [3, 2, 4, 1]
After 1st flip (k=4): A = [1, 4, 2, 3]
After 2nd flip (k=2): A = [4, 1, 2, 3]
After 3rd flip (k=4): A = [3, 2, 1, 4]
After 4th flip (k=3): A = [1, 2, 3, 4], which is sorted. 
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [1,2,3]
Output: []
Explanation: The input is already sorted, so there is no need to flip anything.
Note that other answers, such as [3, 3], would also be accepted.
```

 

**Note:**

1. `1 <= A.length <= 100`
2. `A[i]` is a permutation of `[1, 2, ..., A.length]`

**Idea:**@[Omar Sinan](<https://leetcode.com/omaroh/>)

Find the largest number in the pancake stack, bring the pancake to the top of the stack and then flip the stack to bring it to the bottom. Now we work with the n - 1 pancakes remaining, bring the largest in the n - 1 pancake stack to the top and the flip the n - 1 pancakes to bring that pancake to the second last position and so on... The diagram below explains it visually:

**solution 1**

```python
class Solution(object):
    def pancakeSort(self, A):
        """
        :type A: List[int]
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        done = 0
        ans = []
        while A != sorted(A):
            index = A.index(max(A[0:len(A)-done]))
            if index != 0:
                ans.append(index+1)
            ans.append(len(A)-done)
            A = A[:index+1][::-1] + A[index+1:]
            A[:len(A) - done] = A[:len(A)-done][::-1]
            
            done += 1
        return ans
```

The time complexity is $O(nlogn)$.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def pancakeSort(self, A):
        """
        :type A: List[int]
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        n = len(A)
        ans = []
        for i in range(n, 0, -1):
            idx = A.index(i)
            ans.extend([idx+1, i])
            A = A[:idx:-1] + A[:idx]
        return ans
```

The time complexity is $O(n)$.
