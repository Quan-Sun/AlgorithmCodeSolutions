Given *n* non-negative integers *a1*, *a2*, ..., *an* , where each represents a point at coordinate (*i*, *ai*). *n*vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line *i* is at (*i*, *ai*) and (*i*, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

**Note:** You may not slant the container and *n* is at least 2.

The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.

**Example:**

```python
Input: [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
```

```python
class Solution(object):
    def maxArea(self, height):
        """
        :type height: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        L, R, width, res = 0, len(height) - 1, len(height) - 1, 0
        for w in range(width, 0, -1):
            if height[L] < height[R]:
                res, L = max(res, height[L] * w), L + 1
            else:
                res, R = max(res, height[R] * w), R - 1
        return res
```

The time complexity is $O(logn)$.
