Given a 2D board containing `'X'` and `'O'` (**the letter O**), capture all regions surrounded by `'X'`.

A region is captured by flipping all `'O'`s into `'X'`s in that surrounded region.

**Example:**

```
X X X X
X O O X
X X O X
X O X X
```

After running your function, the board should be:

```
X X X X
X X X X
X X X X
X O X X
```

**Explanation:**

Surrounded regions shouldnâ€™t be on the border, which means that any `'O'` on the border of the board are not flipped to `'X'`. Any `'O'` that is not on the border and it is not connected to an `'O'` on the border will be flipped to `'X'`. Two cells are connected if they are adjacent cells connected horizontally or vertically.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def solve(self, board):
        """
        :type board: List[List[str]]
        :rtype: None Do not return anything, modify board in-place instead.
        """
        if not any(board): return

        m, n = len(board), len(board[0])
        save = [ij for k in range(max(m,n)) for ij in ((0, k), (m-1, k), (k, 0), (k, n-1))]
        while save:
            i, j = save.pop()
            if 0 <= i < m and 0 <= j < n and board[i][j] == 'O':
                board[i][j] = 'S'
                save += (i, j-1), (i, j+1), (i-1, j), (i+1, j)

        board[:] = [['XO'[c == 'S'] for c in row] for row in board]
        
```

The time complexity is $O(m+n)$.

    R, C = len(board), len(board[0])
    if R <= 2 or C <= 2:
      return board
    queue = []
    for r in range(R):
      queue.append((r, 0))
      queue.append((r, C-1))
    for c in range(C):
      queue.append((0, c))
      queue.append((R-1, c))
     
    while queue:
      r, c = queue.pop(0)
      if 0 <= r < R and 0 <= c < C and board[r][c] == 'O':
        board[r][c] = 'S'
        queue.append((r-1, c))
        queue.append((r, c-1))
        queue.append((r+1, c))
        queue.append((r, c+1))
    for r in R:
      for c in C:
        board[r][c] = 'XO'[board[r][c]=='S']
```

The time complexity is $O(m*n)$.
